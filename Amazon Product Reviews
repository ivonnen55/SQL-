--Here the SQL I did for an Amazon Database where I gathered information on product reviews--

SELECT * FROM Reviews 
LIMIT 10; 

SELECT MAX(Score)
FROM Reviews; 

SELECT MIN(Score)
FROM Reviews; 

SELECT COUNT(Score)
FROM Reviews
WHERE Score="5";

SELECT ProductId, Summary 
FROM Reviews 
ORDER BY Score DESC; 

SELECT  HelpfulnessNumerator, HelpfulnessDenominator, Score, Count(score)
FROM Reviews 
WHERE Score
IN (1,2,3)
GROUP BY Score
ORDER BY Score; 

SELECT AVG(Score)
FROM Reviews
